Development Notes
=================


Goals:
------


1. Define a set of common high-level configurations for `build2` like "C++ build for MSVC" (but phrased differently) with decent recommended flags.
2. Allow quick customization of such common high-level configurations, like "Debug or Release, with or without sanitizers, with flags recommended by Jason Turner or Scott Meyers".
3. Designed to be used seemlessly with `build2`'s tools.
4. Enable the possibility to integrate it or rewrite it easilly inside `build2`'s framework (implies easy to read, modify and having most functionality as library, obviously).
5. Ideally, a visual interface to help beginners (in-terminal probably).
